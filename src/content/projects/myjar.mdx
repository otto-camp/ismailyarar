Embarking on the journey of creating my blog website has been a humbling and enlightening experience. Let me walk you through the significant milestones that shaped the development of my blog website.

The first phase was dedicated to implementing the core functionality. I chose to leverage the powerful features provided by Firebase, including Authentication, Firestore, and Storage. This decision ensured a secure and efficient backend infrastructure that would support the website's functionality. To maintain clean and maintainable code, I integrated ESLint and Prettier, which allowed me to establish coding standards and practices. Additionally, I made the bold move of migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, as it offered enhanced development efficiency and improved type safety.

With the core functionality in place, my focus shifted toward launching the project. To monitor the website's performance and gather valuable insights, I seamlessly integrated Google Analytics. This decision allowed me to track user engagement, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall user experience. Recognizing the importance of search engine optimization (SEO), I dedicated time to creating specific meta tags for each page. By doing so, I aimed to optimize the website's visibility and discoverability, ensuring it reaches the intended audience effectively.

Another significant milestone on this roadmap was the migration to a new component library. In my pursuit of a visually appealing and cohesive design, I introduced a dark theme that offered a personalized experience for users. To achieve this, I replaced all Bootstrap and custom CSS components with Mantine components. This transition not only brought consistency to the website's design but also opened up new possibilities for customization and improved user interaction.

Reflecting on this journey, I am immensely grateful for the challenges and growth I experienced along the way. The completion of this roadmap marks an important milestone, but the journey does not end here. I invite you to join me as I continue to enhance and evolve the MyJar blog website, delivering captivating content and striving to provide an exceptional user experience. Together, let's explore the endless possibilities and embark on this exciting adventure.
